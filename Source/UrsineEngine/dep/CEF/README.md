Chromium Embedded Framework
===========================

Because CEF is huge (it's building upon Chromium, which is ~4,000,000+ lines of code) the debug dlls, lib and symbols are huge (~200MB). Release is also pretty large.

In order to build the engine, you must download these files. They are hosted on Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iyk1zgutmei0iqy/CEF%20%28build%203.1750.1738%29.7z?dl=0).
