Chromium Embedded Framework
===========================

Because CEF is huge (it's building upon Chromium, which is ~4,000,000+ lines of code) the debug dlls, lib and symbols are huge (~200MB). Release is also pretty large.

In order to build the engine, you must download these files. They are hosted on Dropbox below.
